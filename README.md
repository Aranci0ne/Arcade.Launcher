A program for downloading Arcaea Fanmade Chart Maker 'Arcade'

To lowiro:
I respect your copyright. However, 'Arcade' is made for free use, for fans who want to create their own level. If you think 'using resources extracted from Arcaea' is not right, and simply replace your copyrighted resources with slightly different hand-made resources is right. I have to say you are really dedicated to being a formalism. The slightly change of both visual and auditory resources, in my opinion, have no difference with directly use original resources, they both violates your right.
We both know this fanmade software is no harm, and is supported by Arcaea's fans. Why break your fans' heart?
